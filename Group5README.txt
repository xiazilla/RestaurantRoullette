Grading Level:
Same grade for all members

Differences: 
Our settings screen does not have the full functionality as promised for our beta release, however, we did complete the database connection as we decided that was of a higher priority. 
Instead, we have pushed working and completing the settings screen to the final release and as of right now we are only missing 2 options on that screen. 
We will add a theme switcher between a light and dark theme for user's preference and either a favorites list or a dietary restrictions checker.
For final release we will also focus on beautifying the application, landing page for the restaurant spinner and UI.

Special Instructions: 
We use firebase for login/logout functionality so we had to use Cocoapods which requires Xcode 8 + 9.
The command to install is "sudo gem install cocoapods", we are using version 1.3.1. 
You also might need to run "pod install" in the base directory to download some of the dependencies.
